# Make Change Project

## Week 1 Homework for Skill Distillery

How it works:  
	1. Program asks for the price of an item and money tendered via a scanner  
	2. If price is equal to money then no change is required and programs stops  
	3. If price > money then user is prompted to enter more money until this condition is met via a do while loop  
	4. If price < money then exact change is given as a count of each denomination via notes and coins. Only counts which are !=0 are shown
